 I'm sick of listening to you
I've had enough of this noise
It's time for you to shut up now
It's time for you to shut up
It's time for you to hush up
It's time for you to hush
It's time for you to be quiet now
I wish you would be quiet
I'm tired of listening to you
Just shut up, okay
I'm sick and tired of listening to you
I'm not interested in what you're saying
I'm not interested in what you have to say
I'm done listening to you
I wish you would shut up
Be quiet
It's time for you to be quiet
Not a peep from you
Please just shut up
Please hush
Please go away
Please be quiet
Oh, shush you
Not another word out of you
I've had enough of your noise
Not another word
Just shut up
No talking
No more
No more talking
No more out of you
No more from you
Let's play the silent game
I told you, shut up
Not another word from you
Go away

I can't take your talking
I can't take another word out of you
Hush, you

I don't have time for your noise
I don't want to hear anything you have to say
I don't have time to listen to what you have to say
I don't want to hear anything from you
I don't want to hear any more out of you
I don't want to hear any more from you
I don't want to hear another word out of you
I don't want to hear another word
I don't want to hear a peep from you
